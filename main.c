We wish you a merry Christmas,
We wish you a merry Christmas,
We wish you a merry Christmas,
And a happy New Year!

Glad tidings we bring
To you and your kin;
Glad tidings for Christmas
And a happy New Year!

We want some figgy pudding,
We want some figgy pudding,
We want some figgy pudding,
Please bring it right here!

For we all like figgy pudding,
for we all like figgy pudding,
For we all like figgy pudding:
so bring some out here!

We won't go until we get some,
We won't go until we get some,
We won't go until we get some,
So bring it out here!

We wish you a Merry Christmas,
We wish you a Merry Christmas,
We wish you a Merry Christmas
And a happy New Year.
